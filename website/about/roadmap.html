      <p>
        We are working actively towards a version of the webif for OpenWrt's
		next generation, Kamikaze. The webif is not finished yet you get its
		status at <a href="http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Kamikaze">
		http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Kamikaze</a>.</p>
      <p>
        OpenWrt Kamikaze represents a substantial and fundamental change. It is not simply a new version of White Russian, but instead a
        complete rewrite of the build root and configuration structure. That is why White Russian went stagnant for so long, the developers
        quit working on it in favor of this more ambitious idealized solution. This new branch of OpenWrt took a long, long time to hash
        out, but now its almost ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ever-popular NVRAM configuration storage system is no longer utilized in Kamikaze. It has been replaced with configuration
        files, many stored in the common format known as 'UCI'. This was done because although an emulated NVRAM storage area to keep tuple
        based configuration data can be easily implemented on any platform, the OpenWrt developers felt it wasn't structured enough for
        their tastes. So, out the window it went.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the webif work with Kamikaze we therefore have to work with this new configuration system. The good news is our webif
        already supports UCI. Some pages, like the QoS page, use the UCI system entirely.
